_geoff_ is an offline geography locator pacakged as a Java library.
Given a pair of coordinates, geoff quickly returns the closest city without querying a web service.

The library comes in four sizes, each with varying quantities of the world's most populous cities.
City data is [sourced](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/) from Geoname and is graciously published under CC BY 3.0.
